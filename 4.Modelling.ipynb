    "# 4. Modelling\n",
    "The goal of the project is to build a product recommendation system for skincare products from Sephora. In this section, I tried couple different models to build recommendation systems: \n",
    "1. A Naive recommender: using a weighted popularity metric that takes into account both a product average rating and the number of reviews, I computed the top 50 products that made up the top 10\\% percentile of the number of reviews and randomly recommened these products to new customers. In other words, each product in this list has received more reviews than 90% of the products on the platform. \n",
    "- Pros: this naive recommender works quite well because products in this list had accummulated many ratings and that their quality were validated. Thus, there is a high probability that new customers will like them.\n",
    "- Cons: This model is not personalized and doesnt give new products a chance. It is also very sensitive to the cut-off value for the number of reviews. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Content-based recommendation system: uses item features to recommend other products similar to a particular product. In this project, I computed the pairwise cosine similarity scores between all products using different feature such as: product name, short descriptions, ingredients, etc.. The idea is that if a customer like a particular product, he/she will also likes something similar to it. \n",
    "- Pros: the product names are fairly descriptive (from most skincare products); thus, recommendations made by scanning for similarity between the product's names, descriptions, etc.. work quite well. This is a simple recommender to build and deploy since most websites/stores have a finite number of products, and the pairwise similarity scores could be pre-computed easily. It only requires data on the products' characteristics and could recommend a product that hasnt been reviewed by any customer.\n",
    "- Cons: the recommendation is not personalized to a customer's preferences.\n",
    "\n"

    "\n",
    "We are going to use this metric that is recommened by datacamp (which was how the IMDB Top 250 movies were suggested):\n",

    "C is the mean vote across the whole report.\n",

Compute Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) vectors for each document which gives a matrix where each column represents a word in the overview vocabulary (all the words that appear in at least one document), and each column represents a product. The TF-IDF score is the frequency of a word occurring in a document, down-weighted by the number of documents in which it occurs. This is done to reduce the importance of words that frequently occur in plot overviews\n",

    "Easier to explain: telling a user that we recommned sth similar to what they have enjoyed in the past makes more sense \n",
    "Easier to deploy, for example: every online store has a finite number of items and their similarity score could be pre-computed \n",
